\* Assignments for 5/20/2022 - Due Monday
Go through the grid gardens game - https://cssgridgarden.com/

Replicate the google.com landing page.

- Make a replica as close as you possibly can using all of the tools we've gone over so far.
- Use CSS Grid for the page layout.
- I want actual links (though they can be dead), and icons that are closely related to what you see on the page, etc....

hint on the input:

- style divs around the sides of the input to match it so you can use the icons a bit easier. \*
